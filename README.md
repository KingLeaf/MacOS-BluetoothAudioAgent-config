# MacOS-BluetoothAudioAgent-config
MacOS config for Bluetooth Headphones

What I'm doing is basically changing every setting to 80 (higher quality than default) and making it stay at that setting. If you set min and max as two different numbers, the system tries to adjust the bit rate while audio is playing, causing it to click and pop.
